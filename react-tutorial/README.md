### Setup

 - Install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (includes Node Package Manager, npm)
 - Install gulp from the command line using `npm install gulp -g`
 - From the root directory, run `npm install` (downloads all dependencies from `package.json` into `node_modules` directory)
 - Also from the root directory, run `gulp` (compiles .jsx and places output JS file into `dist` directory)
 - Open `index.html` in a web browser
