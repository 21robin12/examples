### F# with databases ###

 - We can use F# type providers for easy SQL access straight from F#: http://devcenter.wintellect.com/jwood/access-data-easier-with-f-type-providers
 - This means we wouldn't be using Entity Framework, so would need to define the database in some other way.
 - A database project provides schema compare, which allows us to define a database with .sql files and then update the database as those files change.
